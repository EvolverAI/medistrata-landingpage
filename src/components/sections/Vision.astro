            We envision a healthcare world where data works seamlessly for
            people — not the other way around. A world where every clinician,
            nurse, and administrator can instantly access the information they
            need, in context, with clarity.
        </p>
        <p class="lead-text">
            At MediStrata, we believe that by transforming how medical data is
            organized, understood, and used, we can make care faster, more
            accurate, and profoundly more human.
