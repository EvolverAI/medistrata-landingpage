            Our mission is to make healthcare operations as intelligent and
            efficient as the data that powers them — helping clinicians and
            staff focus their time where it matters most: on care.
        </p>
        <p class="lead-text">
            Healthcare professionals are surrounded by data but short on time.
            MediStrata automates the complexity behind clinical information,
            transforming scattered inputs into clear, structured insight. By
            reducing administrative burden and accelerating decision-making, we
            give clinicians more time to focus on care — improving both outcomes
            and efficiency.
        </p>
        <p class="lead-text">
            Through intelligent data management and user-centric design, we aim
            to revolutionize healthcare operations — making them faster,
            simpler, and more effective for everyone involved.
